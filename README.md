# Dropship Hub

**Drop ship made easy.**

Manage your dropshipping operation from one hub.
Upload Shopify orders and supplier shipments to instantly see:
- Late shipments
- Missing tracking
- Partial shipments
- Supplier issues

## What this does
- Prioritized exceptions queue
- Batched supplier follow-up emails
- Order-level status (internal + customer-facing)

This keeps the tool fast, transparent, and easy to audit.
